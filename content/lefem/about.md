The Digital Database LEFem is the focal point of the ongoing Swiss National Science Foundation PRIMA Project, *Portraying Medieval Women: The Materiality of Female Images and Art Patronage in the Latin-Ruled East (12th–15th centuries)*. This database comprises a comprehensive dataset that encompasses a broad range of comparative data, providing, for the first time, a systematic overview of women in art and artifacts produced within the designated chronological and geographical framework (Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, Greece, Southern Italy, and Sicily). As a multifaceted research tool, it incorporates various types of information, including visual, textual, historical, archaeological, and environmental data, as well as photographs, architectural drawings, maps and measurements, among others. Each entry includes a detailed description of each artwork along with its bibliography. Consequently, the Digital Database LEFem enables remote access and widespread dissemination of the investigated material, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of medieval women and their agency.
